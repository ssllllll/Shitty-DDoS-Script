# Shitty-DDoS-Script


This is a bad ddos tool script i made, there are tons of tools 100 times better but i'll try to improve this and make it public here

Just change

`Target`

`Ip`

`Port`

and choose the thread numbers

## Script 1

The first script just realizes the attack but there's no way to know if it worked

## Script 2

This script realizes the attack and prints the amount of packets sent to the attacked

## Script 3 

Script 2 but improved so its not that slower
